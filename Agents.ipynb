[32;1m[1;3mTo find the top 3 best selling artists, we need to determine which table or tables contain the information about artists and their selling quantities. We can start by checking the available tables using sql_db_list_tables.
Action: sql_db_list_tables
Action Input: ""[0m[38;5;200m[1;3malbums, artists, customers, employees, genres, invoice_items, invoices, media_types, playlist_track, playlists, tracks[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe tables "albums" and "invoice_items" might contain the information we need. I will use sql_db_schema to confirm this.
Action: sql_db_schema
Action Input: albums, invoice_items[0m[33;1m[1;3m
CREATE TABLE albums (
	"AlbumId" INTEGER NOT NULL, 
	"Title" NVARCHAR(160) NOT NULL, 
	"ArtistId" INTEGER NOT NULL, 
	PRIMARY KEY ("AlbumId"), 
	FOREIGN KEY("ArtistId") REFERENCES artists ("ArtistId")
)

/*
3 rows from albums table:

2	Balls to the Wall	2
3	Restless and Wild	2

	"Quantity" INTEGER NOT NULL,

*/[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe "albums" table contains the "ArtistId" column, which could be used to link to the "artists" table to get the artist names. The "invoice_items" table contains the "Quantity" column, which represents the selling quantities. I will now write a SQL query to retrieve the top 3 best selling artists and their selling quantities.
Action: sql_db_query
Action Input: SELECT artists.Name, SUM(invoice_items.Quantity) AS Selling_Quantities
FROM artists
JOIN albums ON artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId
JOIN tracks ON albums.AlbumId = tracks.AlbumId
JOIN invoice_items ON tracks.TrackId = invoice_items.TrackId
GROUP BY artists.ArtistId
ORDER BY Selling_Quantities DESC
